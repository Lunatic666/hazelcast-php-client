# Hazelcast PHP Client [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Lunatic666/hazelcast-php-client.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Lunatic666/hazelcast-php-client)

PHP client implementation for [Hazelcast](http://www.hazelcast.org)

# Status

Not-even-pre-development-alpha. Nothing works. Classes, class structure and API change all the time.
So if you find something funny in the code, I probably know about it ;-)
